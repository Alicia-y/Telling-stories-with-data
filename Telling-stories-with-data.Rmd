## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
a <- data1 %>%
  clean_names()
b <- data2 %>%
  clean_names()
year_2020 <- a %>%
  filter(year == 2020) %>%
  drop_na(street1) %>%
  drop_na(street2)
year_2020_location <- tibble(year_2020$year, year_2020$street1, year_2020$street2)
```


```{r}
camera <- b %>%
  filter(year >= 2020)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
